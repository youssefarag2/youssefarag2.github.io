CV FILE PLACEMENT

Please place your CV or resume PDF file in this directory and name it 'cv.pdf'. 

The file will be accessible for download from the "Download CV" button in the About section of your portfolio website.

Important: Make sure your CV is up-to-date and formatted professionally before adding it here.

Alternative options:
- If your CV filename is different, you can update the link in the index.html file.
- You can also host your CV on Google Drive or Dropbox and update the link to point to that location.
